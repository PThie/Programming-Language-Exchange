# Programming Language Exchange

This repository is dedicated to try out concepts in different programming languages. The focus lies on languages often used in data analysis like Python, R, SQL.

Note that there might be other ways to accomplish certain task. This is also a place for me to test things out and learn new concepts in other languages. Feel free to reach out in any form.
